eQual is a complete open-source low-code web-based framework, designed to efficiently create and manage **modern softwares** that can **adapt to any Application Logic**.

"Not everyone can be a fullstack developer, but with eQual, anyone can develop like one": Developing an application from end to end is extremely complex and requires a wide range of skills that few people possess on their own. eQual's mission is to **enable any developer to create production-ready applications** by helping them compensate for the aspects they are less proficient in.

eQual offers a native Low-Code approach, based on the definition of the application logic and components (rather than on code or the language used).

Data is modeled via entities, to which a large part of the application logic is associated (workflow, roles, events, actions, policies), which are manipulated by the ORM, with which it is possible to interact using CQRS controllers.

In turn, the Controllers can be invoked via an API.

eQual offers tools that allow the visual consultation and editing of the different components, in turn in the form of relational diagrams, and entity, workflow, view, menu, and translation editors.

It also has a rendering engine that allows views and menus to be assembled in order to define a complete application.

This mechanism enables eQual to generate an application without writing a single line of code, providing both a user interface and an API that can be connected to any external service.



## Features

Beside its revolutionary edge, eQual is a fully-featured framework providing an amazing set of both traditional and innovative features.


### Low-Code
:white_check_mark: **Visual Workbench for building Apps**: No-code editor for all components (models, views, routes, ...).  
:white_check_mark: **Instant APIs Without Code**: Auto-documented controllers with an announcement system.  
:white_check_mark: **Desktop & mobile**: Customizable layout to fit any device screen.  
:white_check_mark: **Views**: Create any view without coding - form, lists, menus, charts, Dashboard.  

### Architecture
:white_check_mark: **CQRS architecture**: Division of controllers into Action Handlers, Data Providers, and App Providers.  
:white_check_mark: **MVC segregation**: Strict distinction between Models (entities), Views and Controllers.  
:white_check_mark: **Dependency injection**: Inject services into classes, methods, controllers, or functions anywhere.  
:white_check_mark: **Data Adaptation**: Automatically transform received data based on format and context.  
:white_check_mark: **Services Extensibility**: Ability to extend services behavior, and to register custom ones.  
:white_check_mark: **Cascading Configuration**: Overridable settings at different levels (default, global, package).  
:white_check_mark: **I/O as HTTP messages**: Inputs & outputs are handled as text in all contexts (default is 'application/json').  

### Entities & ORM
:white_check_mark: **Model definition**: With support for inheritance, workflows, actions, roles and policies, transitions, and events.  
:white_check_mark: **CRUD operations**: Perform create, read, update, and delete operations on individual objects or collections.  
:white_check_mark: **Domains**: Simple array notation for any possible boolean condition, either directly or with references.  
:white_check_mark: **Date References**: Enables defining a date relative to another date using specific syntactic notations.  
:white_check_mark: **Explicit typing (Usages)**: Attach any value to a Usage that can be flawlessly adapted (converted) to any other language or environment.  

### Security
:white_check_mark: **Authentication Management**: HTTP Auth support (JWT) & 3 levels of visibility (public, protected, private).  
:white_check_mark: **Granular access control**: Set permissions of any kind at any level (ACL, RBAC, PBAC, ABAC, ReBAC).  
:white_check_mark: **Security Policies**: Restrict access to a set of users or groups, based on their IP or Schedule.
