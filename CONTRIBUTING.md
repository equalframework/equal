# Contributing to eQual

We love your input and new contributions to eQual are most welcome and encouraged! :octocat:

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

This document contains notes and guidelines on how to contribute to eQual.

## Joining the project

Active committers and contributors are invited to introduce themselves and request commit access to the project on the
Discord [#join](https://discord.com/invite/xNAXyhbYBp) channel. If you think you can help, we'd love to have you!

## First-time contributors

There are always a few issues
tagged [Good first issues](https://github.com/equalframework/equal/labels/good%20first%20issue) to make it easy to get
started.

If you're interested in working on an issue:

* Make sure it has either a `good-first-issue` label added.

* Add a comment on the issue and wait for the issue to be assigned before you start working on it (this helps to avoid
  multiple people working on similar issues).

## Bugs and Issues

Please report these on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/equalframework/equal/issues) . Please do not use issues for
support requests: for help using eQual, please consider Stack Overflow.

Well structured, detailed bug reports are hugely valuable for the project.

Guidelines for reporting bugs:

* Check the issue search to see if it has already been reported.
* Isolate the problem to a simple test case.
* Please include a code snippet that demonstrates the bug. If filing a bug against master, you may reference the latest
  code using the URL of the repository of the branch (e.g.
  [https://github.com/equalframework/equal/blob/master/eq.lib.php](https://github.com/equalframework/equal/blob/master/eq.lib.php) - changing the filename to point at the file you need
  as appropriate).
* Please provide any additional details associated with the bug, if it's generic or only happens with a certain
  configuration or data set.

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as for accepting pull requests.

## Any contributions you make will be under the LGPL 3.0 Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the
same [LGPL License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the
maintainers if that's a concern.

## Submitting Pull Requests

We use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through Pull
Requests.
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we
use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from
   `master` ([https://github.com/equalframework/equal/fork](https://github.com/equalframework/equal/fork))
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
3. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
6. Create a new Pull Request

### Guidelines for submitting a Pull Request:

* Before opening a PR for additions or changes, please discuss those by filing an issue
  on [GitHub](https://github.com/equalframework/equal/issues) or asking about it
  on [Discord](https://discord.gg/xNAXyhbYBp) (#general channel). This will save you development time by getting
  feedback upfront and make review faster by giving the maintainers more context and details.
* Before submitting a PR, ensure that the code works with all PHP versions that we support (currently PHP 7.0 to PHP
  7.4); that the test suite passes and that your code lints.
* If you've changed some behavior, update the 'description' and 'help' attributes (when present).
* If you are going to submit a pull request, please fork from `master`, and submit your pull request back as a
  fix/feature branch referencing the GitHub issue number
* Please include a Unit Test to verify that a bug exists, and that this PR fixes it.
* Please include a Unit Test to show that a new Feature works as expected.
* Please don't "bundle" several changes into a single PR; submit one PR for each discrete change and/or fix.

## Submitting a package or a library

### Guidelines for submitting a package or a library:

* Check that your package will pass the consistency tests (`$ ./equal.run --do=test_package-consistency`).
* Make sure your package comes with unit tests (in the `packages/{your_package}/tests/`) and that classes and
  controllers have descriptions and helpers.

## Submitting eQual core contributions

### Guidelines

* All new development should be on feature/fix branches, which are then merged to the `master` branch once stable and
  approved; so the `master` branch is always the most up-to-date, working code
* Avoid breaking changes unless there's an upcoming major release, which is infrequent. We encourage people to write
  distinct libraries and/or packages for most new advanced features, and care a lot about backwards compatibility.

## Unit Tests

When writing Unit Tests, please

* Always try to write Unit Tests for both the happy and unhappy scenarios.
* Put all assertions in the Test itself, not in external classes or functions (even if this means code duplication
  between tests).
* Always try to split the test logic into ``AAA`` callbacks `arrange()`, `act()`, `assert()` and `rollback()` for each
  Test.
* If you change any global settings, make sure that you reset to the default in the `rollback()`.
* Don't overcomplicate test code by testing several behaviors in the same test.

This makes it easier to see exactly what is being tested when reviewing the PR. We want to be able to see it in the PR,
without having to hunt in other unchanged classes to see what the test is doing.
